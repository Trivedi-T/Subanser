# Subanser
A simple Python Script you must take a Try !

# Hi Everyone !
# I have Created a Simple python Script which will help you
# in checking if the subdomain is available or not
# If you have a big bunch of subdomain such as 500 or something it is hard
# to manually go and check if it's available or not.
# How To use it ?
#Get all the subdomains of the target you need to check
#Give it a name for example:-sample.txt
#Git clone the repo
#copy the file sample.txt to cloned folder here Subanser
# command:- python3 subanser.py
#Here I am attaching an simple sample.txt containing some domains you can edit with your file or subdomains.

#Errors:-
In case if you got any error just contact me or write the issue in issues Section
